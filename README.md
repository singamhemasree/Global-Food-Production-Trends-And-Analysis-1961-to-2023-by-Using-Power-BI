🌾 Global Food Production Trends and Analysis (1961–2023)

📘 Overview

This project presents a detailed Power BI dashboard analyzing global food production data from 1961 to 2023. The goal is to visualize production trends of key crops across different regions and identify major contributors to global food supply.
The dataset provides insights into how agricultural output has evolved over time, highlighting technological growth, population demand, and regional specialization.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze and compare the production of major food crops such as Rice, Wheat, Maize, Coffee, Tea, and Fruits.

To visualize global production growth from 1961 to 2023.

To identify top producing countries for each crop.

To understand how climatic and economic factors influence agricultural patterns.

📊 Key Insights

Rice production reached 268.56 billion tonnes, showing its importance as a staple food, mainly in Asia.

Wheat production was slightly higher at 282 billion tonnes, highlighting global dependence on wheat-based products.

Tea production was recorded at around 2 billion tonnes, reflecting its cultural and economic value.

Coffee production is dominated by countries like Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia, which play a major role in global exports.

Fruit production shows diversity — bananas, apples, oranges, and avocados vary by region and climate.

Maize production saw a significant rise after 2000, indicating increasing demand for food, livestock feed, and biofuels.

The overall trend (1961–2023) shows continuous growth in global food production due to technological advances and population increase.
